pydevd_reload
==============

This is a reload library based on pydevd_reload.py from https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger. The original library is used in PyDev & PyCharm.


Installation
--------------

If you don't have much time, just perform

 `$ pip install pydevd_reload`

which will install the module(without tests) on your system.

Also, you can just copy & paste the pydevd_reload.py which require no third-party dependency.


Usage
--------------

Just import pydevd_reload and use pydevd_reload.xreload as the reload built-in function.

.. code-block:: python

    import pydevd_reload
    pydevd_reload.xreload(module_instance)

pydevd_reload reload code objects in a module by default, and provide ``__xreload_old_new__`` and ``__xreload_after_reload_update__`` custom hooks which allow user to update data in a module:


Original module:

.. code-block:: python

    class B(object):
        CONSTANT = 1

        def foo(self):
            return self.CONSTANT


Updated module:

.. code-block:: python

    class B(object):
        CONSTANT = 2

        # Custom hooks can be added in a reload.
        def __xreload_old_new__(cls, name, old, new):
            if name == 'CONSTANT':
                cls.CONSTANT = new
                return True
            return False
        __xreload_old_new__ = classmethod(__xreload_old_new__)

        def foo(self):
            return self.CONSTANT


Improvements
--------------

This standalone pydevd_reload library has following improvements than original pydevd_reload.py:

- Removed pydevd dependency.

- Removed limitation that functions with decorators cannot be handled. *

- Added support to update function closure. *

- Added code object name check to avoid update monkey patched code. *

- Refined reload hooks. (eg, __xreload_old_new__ and __xreload_after_reload_update__)

- Fixed __file__ attribute in namespace so they will be updated.

- Fixed compiled python file support.

- Fixed reload failed when python code compiled from different paths.


Testing
--------------
If you have the source code you can run the tests with

 `$ python pydevd_reload/tests/test_pydevd_reload.py`
